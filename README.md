# 📌 Python Basics - Part 2

## 📖 Project Overview
This project is part of my Python learning journey using **Google Colab** with the notebook `Python_Basics_Part2_Learner.ipynb`. Here, I explored fundamental Python concepts, including:

- **Shortcut and Comparison Operators**
- **If Statements**
- **Loops (for and while)**
- **Indexing**
- **Tuples and Dictionaries**

This knowledge is essential for building logic and control flow in Python programming.

## 🚀 Key Learnings & Code Examples

### 🔹 Shortcut and Comparison Operators
I practiced using **comparison operators** such as `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=` to evaluate conditions.

```python
x = 10
y = 20
print(x < y)  # Output: True
print(x != y)  # Output: True
```

### 🔹 If Statements
I implemented **conditional statements** to execute different blocks of code based on conditions.

```python
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```

### 🔹 Loops (For & While)
I used **loops** to iterate over sequences and repeat actions efficiently.

```python
# For Loop Example
for i in range(5):
    print("Iteration:", i)

# While Loop Example
x = 0
while x < 3:
    print("While Loop Iteration:", x)
    x += 1
```

### 🔹 Indexing
I learned how to access specific elements within sequences like lists and strings.

```python
my_list = ["Python", "is", "awesome"]
print(my_list[0])  # Output: Python
```

### 🔹 Tuples & Dictionaries
I explored **tuples**, which are immutable collections, and **dictionaries**, which store key-value pairs.

```python
# Tuple Example
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
print(my_tuple[1])  # Output: 2

# Dictionary Example
dict_example = {"name": "Andreia", "age": 25}
print(dict_example["name"])  # Output: Andreia
```
